# Multi-Level-Marketing-MLM-Simulation-System-in-C


A console-based Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) system implemented in C. This program uses a binary search tree (BST) structure to manage member data (ID, name, password, purchase history) and leverages OpenMP for parallel operationsâ€”such as searching, updating commissions, and aggregating statistics. The system also features a referral mechanism, dynamic pricing rules for different purchase counts, and the ability to generate financial reports.
